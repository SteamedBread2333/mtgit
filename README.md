# mtgit
ü§úüèº When a project is maintained in two repositories and one of the repositories restricts the current user's ability to use Git, welcome use this tool.

## Detailed Explanation
In some collaborative development scenarios, a project may be split across two Git repositories, such as for separating code between **development and production environments** or isolating sensitive data. In these cases, one repository may have **access restrictions** for certain users, limiting their ability to perform Git operations like commits, pushes, or cloning. To address this, specialized tools can be used to **sync changes**, **manage branches**, or **automate commit transfers** between the restricted and unrestricted repositories, ensuring a seamless workflow.

## Installation
Nodejs is required and Download the project.
